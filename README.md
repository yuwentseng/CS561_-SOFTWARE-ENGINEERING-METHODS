<h2>CS561 Software Engineering: Methods</h2>
Overview
Think of the project as a tool to help you get your next job. It is a chance to show off what you learn.

It is a team assignment comprised of three 3-week sections each called a "sprint." You will use Scrum.

Your team gets to decide the details of your project (including requirements, what tools/languages you use, etc.) Because you will need to work with your teammates, you should choose a team with skills comparable and compatible to your own. Because your team will need to get real people to use your system, you should choose a project topic for which you are likely to be able to find test users. One easy way to do this is to create a system that other students in the class will want to use.

What you turn in
For each sprint shown on the schedule, one person on your team will send an email to the TA with an attachment PDF containing the following 8 sections:

Your list of team members who participated in the sprint and what each of them did
A list of user stories (requirements) fully completed during this sprint (incomplete or buggy work doesn't count)
Evidence of the daily Scrum (e.g., a URL where the TA can access a zip file or online photo-journal containing one photo of your team for each weekday that you held a Scrum)
Evidence of regular integration and testing (e.g., a log showing that you did integration testing at least once per week, and that all unit tests were checked in no later than the code they tested)
Evidence that you held a Sprint Review with users (e.g., photo of the meeting plus notes on who attended)
Evidence of people using your system (e.g., typically a link to photos, logs, or other data from your Sprint Review, including notes on system strengths/weaknesses)
Evidence that your team held a Sprint Retrospective (e.g., a link to a photo of the meeting plus notes on what you decided to improve in future sprints)
A brief summary of how each person on your team contributed to the sprint. As part of this, indicate who got to be ScrumMaster and Product Owner during this sprint.
It is ok if your PDF is very short, even as little as a page or two of bulletpoints. Your TA may have questions about your submission, may ask you to demo your system, or may ask for a URL where he or she can try out your system. The TA might ask specific individuals on your team to talk about the work that they contributed; therefore, do not lie or exaggerate when discussing what your team members contributed. The TA will typically ask for such information when your submission is unclear or vague, limiting the TA's ability to give you points for your work.

Grading
After reviewing all the work by all teams for each sprint, your TA will grade each team on three dimensions:

Completion of deliverables:
For your first sprint, your team should have completed several user stories, resulting in a barely functional system.
For your second sprint, your team should have completed many user stories, resulting in a system that's actually useful for something.
For your third (final) sprint, your team should have completed most or all of your user stories, resulting in a system that's desirable--something that a graduate student should be proud to show off to a future employer, and the kind of system that OSU would want to be associated with.
Performance of agile practices:
You must do a daily Scrum ("standup") every weekday (except holidays)
You must do 3-week sprints
You must appoint and follow a ScrumMaster and a Product Owner
You must do a Sprint Review and a Sprint Retrospective
You must do a lenient form of test-driven development. (It's ok to write your unit tests immediately after the code that you test, but you may not check in your code before your unit tests are written and passed.)
You must use source code control. (Git is preferable but not required.)
You must selectively use non-Scrum practices when doing so helps you complete your project in an agile manner.
Evidence of use by real users
For your first sprint, one person (outside your team) must use the system.
For your second, several people (4 is fine) must use the system.
For your third, many people (10+) must use the system. Plan accordingly.
In general, the TA will give the same grade on the sprint to every teammate for the criteria above. The main exception will be when it's clear that one or two teammates were holding the entire team back. In that case, those students who dragged the team's grade down will receive an extra penalty on top of the team score. (This is one very important reason why you should try to choose teammates with skills reasonably close to your own.)

If you think that your TA hasn't given you a reasonable grade on your sprint, then you may contact your TA to request a meeting. At the meeting, you must provide evidence of why you should get a higher grade. You may appeal the TA's decision to an instructor (either Kishore or Chris), but it is very rare to overturn a TA's grading. In general, TAs are very reasonable about grading, and when a dispute occurs, it is typically because students failed to provide any evidence that they deserved a higher grade.

Project FAQs
Do I have to do the project with a team?
Yes, you need to be in a team of 4-8 people. Developers almost always work in teams. It's very good practice for you.
Can we use my favorite language/tool/platform?
Yes, if your team agrees. Don't be a pain about it, though. Talk it through, discuss the pros and cons, and then come to a consensus.
I have an idea for a project. Is X a good project idea?
Pretty much 100% of the time, yes, it's a good project idea. I can't remember ever hearing of a bad project idea. If everybody on your team likes it, and if you can do it with Scrum, and if you think you can get 10+ people to try using it, then it's a good project.
What if my teammates don't like me and are mean to me?
Most of the time, you're the problem, almost always because you're not being responsible. But if you think people are being mean, let's talk about it. Sometimes small changes lead to big impacts--so some problems are sometimes easily fixed.
I already have this other project I'm working on or completed. Can I count it as my CS561 project?
No, you can't. But what you can do is complete a separate project for this class and then reuse that code in your other project or vice versa. For example, if you want to use non-credit seminar time to work on code for your project, so much the better.
Do we have to use Scrum, test-driven development, and source-code control?
Not exactly. You do need to perform them to the extent that they play into your project grade. But you can also incorporate non-Scrum, non-agile practices as long as you find them helpful and they don't distract from living out the values of agile.
Can we turn our PDF in late?
Yes. The penalty, however, is half of your team's points.
Do we have to turn in our code?
No, but the TA might want to ask you questions or look at your code, usually because your PDF was vague or unclear (so he or she can't justify giving you a good grade without getting more information).
What about source code control?
Yes.
What tips do you have for working together? 
First, most teams can benefit from working in pairs during the first sprint or two. You're still learning this material, and working together will greatly decrease the number of bugs you have. (If you ask the professor about a bug, he will usually ask you who you wrote the code with, and if you wrote it alone, then he will tell you to try getting your teammates to troubleshoot your bug before trying to do so himself. Fixing your code isn't the instructors' job, graduate student!)

Second, if you're going to use a server, then designate one member of your team to be in charge of deployment each sprint. Everybody else should also be able to do integration testing on another server (for example, a local server on their own machine). Figure out the details of this as part of the first sprint.

Third, during every meeting and especially during your Sprint Retrospective with your team, be very "present." This means preparing ahead of time, bringing your full attention, and listening as hard as you can about how to succeed. I find that students who miss meetings, physically or mentally, usually are the ones who hold their teams back and end up getting bad grades. Don't be "that guy" (or gal).
